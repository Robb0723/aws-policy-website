            <h2>Amazon Joins Forces with AI Security Standards Group, Microsoft, OpenAI, Others</h2>
            <p><strong>By Gladys Rama</strong> - 07/18/2024</p>
            <img id="banner" style="width: 600px;" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRNVEeTt_PWURE86AEgwLXCugPHvlXP0CIicQ&s" alt="AI Security Standards Group">
            <p>A new alliance focused on advancing AI security standards has attracted high-profile supporters, including Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, and more.</p>
            <p>The Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI) was established on Thursday, positioning itself as an "open-source initiative" aimed at providing guidance and tools to all practitioners and developers to ensure the creation of Secure-by-Design AI systems.</p>
            <p>Amazon is among the founding members, along with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cisco, Cohere, Chainguard, GenLab, and Wiz. The list of "founding Premier Sponsors" features Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, IBM, Intel, and PayPal.</p>
            <p>Other members encompass academics, industry leaders, and additional experts.</p>
            <p>The primary goal of CoSAI is to develop comprehensive security measures that tackle the risks specific to AI systems, which the group believes are challenging to address in the current AI environment. This is due to the fragmented, uncoordinated, and inconsistent nature of existing AI security standards efforts.</p>
            <p>While acknowledging the work of these efforts and planning to collaborate with other AI security groups, CoSAI believes it is uniquely positioned to set standards that are widely accepted and implemented.</p>
            <blockquote>"From the start, AWS AI infrastructure and the Amazon services built on it have incorporated security and privacy features that offer customers robust isolation and control over their systems and data," stated Paul Vixie, vice president and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services, in a statement.</blockquote>
            <p>"As a sponsor of CoSAI, we're eager to work with the industry to develop essential standards and practices that will enhance AI security for all."</p>
            <p>According to CoSAI's founding charter, the group plans to identify and share solutions for AI security risks such as "model theft, poisoning of training data, malicious input injection, large-scale abuse prevention, membership inference attacks, model inversion attacks, or gradient inversion attacks to extract private information from the training data."</p>
            <p>However, the group does not consider the following areas to be within its scope: "misinformation, hallucinations, hateful or abusive content, bias, malware creation, generation of phishing content, or other topics related to content safety."</p>
            <p><strong>AI Software Supply Chain Security:</strong> The group will explore methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems based on their origin. This includes examining who trained the AI system and how, as well as whether its training process could have exposed it to vulnerabilities at any stage.</p>
            <p><strong>Security Framework Development:</strong> The group will identify "investments and mitigation strategies" to address the security vulnerabilities present in current AI systems, as well as those that may arise in future versions.</p>
            <p><strong>Security and Privacy Governance:</strong> The group will establish guidelines to assist AI developers and vendors in assessing the risk level of their systems.</p>
